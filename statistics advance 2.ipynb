    "\n",
    "2.Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation controls the spread or variability of the data. A smaller standard deviation\n",

    "\n",
    "The combination of mean and standard deviation fully describes the normal distribution. When you have a larger standard\n",

    "1.Random Sampling: The samples are randomly drawn from the population, and each sample is independent of the others.\n",

    "2.Sample Size: As the sample size (n) increases, the sampling distribution becomes increasingly close to a normal \n",

    "\n",
    "1.Approximation to Normality: It allows us to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean (or other sample\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of the sampling \n",
    "distribution of the sample mean (or other sample statistics) under certain conditions. To apply the CLT effectively, several\n",
    "key assumptions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Random Sampling: The samples must be selected randomly and independently from the population of interest. This means that\n",
    " each observation in the sample is chosen independently of the others, and each individual has an equal chance of being \n",
    "included in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations within each sample should be independent of each other. This means that the value of one\n",
    " observation should not depend on or affect the value of another observation within the same sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Sample Size: While the CLT does not specify an exact sample size, it generally assumes that the sample size (n) is\n",
    "  sufficiently large. While there is no fixed threshold, a commonly cited guideline is that n should be at least 30. However,\n",
    "the appropriateness of this guideline can vary depending on the specific context and the underlying population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Population Distribution: The CLT does not require the population to be normally distributed. It applies to populations with\n",
    "  any shape of distribution, as long as the population has a finite mean (μ) and a finite variance (σ²). This allows the CLT\n",
    "to be used for a wide range of data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Mean and Variance: The population from which the samples are drawn should have a finite mean (μ) and a finite variance (σ²).\n",
    " These parameters characterize the population distribution's central tendency and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Independence of Sampling Distribution: The sampling distribution of the sample mean should also be independent of the sample\n",
    " size. In other words, as the sample size increases, the shape of the sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while these assumptions are necessary for the CLT to hold theoretically, in practice, the CLT can \n",
    "still provide reasonable approximations even when some of these assumptions are not met, especially if the sample size is\n",
    "large. Additionally, various statistical techniques and tests have been developed to address violations of these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Central Limit Theorem is a powerful tool for making statistical inferences, and its assumptions guide the \n",
    "conditions under which it can be applied effectively. Understanding these assumptions is essential for using the CLT correctly\n",
    "and interpreting the results of statistical analyses."
